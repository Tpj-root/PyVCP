Thinking about it, that is for analogue-input jogging.

For MPG jogging you use the axis.N.jog-enable and axis.N.jog-counts pins.

Assuming that the MPG is connected to motenc.0.encoder.00

net jog-all motenc.0.encoder.00.counts => axis.N.jog-counts
net x-jog-enable motenc.0.in.00 => axis.N.jog-enable
net y-jog-enable motenc.0.in.01 => axis.N.jog-enable
net z-jog-enable motenc.0.in.02 => axis.N.jog-enable

Or similar.
If you don't have physical axis-select switches then you can use the ones from the gui: halui.joint.0.is-selected for the X axis, for example.

If you have a mesa card, inputs are in abundance. By specifying binary coded inputs, you only use 3 inputs for axis selection and 2 for scale selection and one of the Mesa MPG inputs for the jog wheel. Plus you can use the other buttons for whatever you like.

I purchased ATWGP 01-6BB with no display
www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Intellige...15.89.1a1333c5PvucJq

The realy box appears to have changed
Key parameters are:
5 volt encoder,
Coded (binary) output for axis selection (decode with Mux8)

Quite expensive but its been very reliable

axis.N.jog-counts - (s32, in) Connect to the counts pin of an external encoder to use a physical jog wheel.
axis.N.jog-enable - (bit, in) When TRUE (and in manual mode), any change in jog-counts will result in motion. When false, jog-counts is ignored.
axis.N.jog-scale - (float, in) Sets the distance moved for each count on jog-counts, in machine units.






axis.N.jog-vel-mode - (bit, in) When FALSE (the default), the jogwheel operates in position mode. The axis will move exactly jog-scale units for each count, regardless of how long that might take. When TRUE, the wheel operates in velocity mode - motion stops when the wheel stops, even if that means the commanded motion is not completed.
